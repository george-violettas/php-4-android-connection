# php-4-android-connection
php files with an sql simple database (sqli.sql), which is a simple-one-table users dB. The php files are executing all necessary jobs with the dB like delete, add, update, select, etc. The idea is that those php files will be called from android projects and fetch data, or push actions like delete and update.
